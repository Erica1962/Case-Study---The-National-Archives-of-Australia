  <h4>Project Summary</h4>
  <p>The National Archives of Australia (NAA) is the home of Australia's documented history of important events. Offering
    online records searches for a wide variety of catalogues, workshops, exhibitions and events the NAA provides the
    public a place to learn and remember Australia's past.</p>
    
    <p>The intent of this project was to increase visibility of the online records and catalogues offerings of the NAA to
    heighten awareness of the wealth of knowledge freely searchable for students, researchers and the general public.

  <h4>The Problem</h4>
  <p>The National Archives of Australia (NAA) is the primary location for people who immigrated to Australia before 1973 to find their immigration date. This information is critical for filling in forms for some Government agencies. However, the current design doesn't highlight that the records are searchable online.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="copyright">
    <h4>The Solution</h4>
    <p>Redesigning the NAA website’s primary and secondary navigation, and highlighting that the records are searchable online, would provide the user with clear direction on how to find their imigration date in the records search.</p>

    <div><h7>Understanding the User</h7></div>
    <h8>To set the scene of the potential user of the National Archives of Australia website and what they might be
      experiencing as problems using the website, a Proto Persona was created to identify what the demographics of the
      website’s potential user might be.
      This was followed by an assessment of the current website to establish the most likely user flows taken by the user in navigating their way to the immigration section of the website, a huristics assessment and WCAG colour accessibility testing.</h8>
    
      <div id="protoposona"></div>
<div id="userflow"></div>
<div><h7>User Interface Analysis</h7></div>
<h8>Building on the initial ideas of the potential user and how they might perceive the website a user research plan was created and implemented to conduct an analysis of the interface from the perspective of a real use. Aspects for investigation included navigation of the website, heuristics and any pain points the user identifies.</h8>
<div><h9>User Test Plan</h9></div>
<h10>Objectives: 
  <li>To test how intuitive it is to identify and progress through the immigration search of the NAA website.</li>
  <li>To test if the user is able to identify how to purchase a digital copy without signing up to NAA.</li>
  <li>Identify pain points the user encounters throughout the searching process. </li>
</h10>
  <div>
  <div><h10>Methodology:</h10></div>
  <h10>Use testing wil be conducted to collect qualitative data from 5 participants. The testing will be recorded via zoom and notes for further data anlaysis. Participants will be provided with 4 tasks to complete and assessed for how quickly they can identify the intuitive signaling, move through the user flow ans ask for their opinion of the aesthetics and design of the website.</h10>

<div id="UserTesting">
  <h9>User Testing Analysis</h9></div>
<h10>The process of analysisng the test data was performed on Miro and included establishing commom themes in the data utalising an Affinity Diagram followed by a frequency diagram to establish the core issues. </h10>
